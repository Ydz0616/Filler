Subject: Application for Software & Systems Engineering Roles

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in engineering opportunities at your company. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at UC San Diego with a 4.0 GPA, and holding a B.S. in Computer Science from Duke University, I am deeply passionate about building scalable distributed systems and robust AI infrastructure.

My technical background sits at the intersection of DevOps and Machine Learning, allowing me to bridge the gap between model development and production deployment. During my time as a Software Engineer Intern, I architected a high-availability Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 using ArgoCD, achieving 99.9% uptime. This experience gave me hands-on expertise in building reliable, automated CI/CD workflows that support rapid engineering iteration.

Beyond infrastructure, I bring strong capabilities in data engineering. As a Research Assistant, I engineered a distributed ETL pipeline using Dask to process 4TB of raw GPS data, reducing processing time from days to under 20 minutes. I also designed and deployed SOTA Transformer models for mobility prediction, optimizing them for real-world inference.

I am eager to bring this blend of infrastructure reliability (Docker, K8s) and algorithmic efficiency to your engineering team, helping to build tools and systems that scale.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Yuandong Zhang
